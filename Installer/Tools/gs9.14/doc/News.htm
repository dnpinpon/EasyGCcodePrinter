<h2><a name="Version9.14"></a>Version 9.14 (2014-03-26)</h2>

<p>This is the tenth full release in the stable 9.x series, and is
primarily a maintenance release.

<p> Highlights in this release include:
<ul>
<li>
<p>pdfwrite now uses the same color management engine as Ghostscript rendering
devices (by default LCMS2). This provides much better control over color
conversion and color management generally, but will result in some small color
differences when compared to the old system.

<p>It is no longer necessary to specify UseCIEColor (and we very much encourage
you not to do this) or the ProcessColorModel if you want to convert a PDF file
to a specific color space, simply set the ColorConverionStrategy appropriately.

<p>We do not expect any major problems to arise with this new code, but for the
duration of this release a new switch -dPDFUseOldCMS is available which will
restore the old color management.
See: <a href="Ps2pdf.htm#Color_Conversion_and_Management">Color Conversion and Management</a>

<p>Please note that due to constraints of the PDF/A-1 specification, the new
color management does not yet apply when producing PDF/A files.
</li>
<li>
<p> A new device 'eps2write' has been added which allows for the creation of
EPS files using the ps2write device instead of the old (deprecated and removed)
pswrite device. This produces considerably better quality EPS files than
the old epswrite device which is now also deprecated and will be removed in a
future release.
</li>
<li>
<p> ps2write now has a feature to allow customisation of the output for specific
devices. Please see PSDocOptions and PSPageOptions described in ps2ps2.htm
<a href="Ps2ps2.htm#AdditionalDistillerParams">Additional Distiller Params</a>
</li>
<li>
<p> Ghostscript now reduces memory usage when processing PDF files that use
transparency and output is to display devices such as Windows display or x11
(i.e. devices that are strictly full framebuffer devices), and to high level
vector devices that cannot reproduce the PDF transparency model, such as the
ps2write device or pdfwrite when 'flattening' to PDF 1.3 or earlier
(-dCompatibilityLevel=1.3). This uses banding (clist) files to render the
transparenct areas in bands to reduce memory use, and unlike the existing
page level banding, this is hidden from the target device.
</li>
<li>
<p> Ghostscript can now collect information for pages in temp files (in
Ghostscript's clist format), then render and output pages for the job in arbitrary
order, including normal, reverse, odd, even, or any order or subset of the pages.
This is controlled with the --saved-page=___ option. (Note that this only applies
to rendering devices, and not high level devices such as pdfwrite and ps2write.)
See: <a href="Use.htm#Deferred_Page_Rendering">Deferred Page Rendering</a>
</li>
<li>
<p> The Ghostscript device architecture has been extended so that, when
rendering bands into multiple threads, it is now possible to perform
post-processing in multiple threads, such as downscale, post-render halftoning,
or compression. Previously, post processing was only possible in the single
main thread. This can improve performance significantly. 
</li>
<li>
<p> Ghostscript has a new "pwgraster" output device for PWG Raster output
</li>
<li>
<p> The CUPS device now has improved support for PPD-less printing
</li>
<li>
<p>Plus the usual round of bug fixes, compatibility changes, and incremental improvements.
</li>
</ul>
